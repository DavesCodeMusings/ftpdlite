# Contributing to FTPdLite
Thanks for your interest in contributing to the project.

The goals of FTPdLite are:
* Minimalism
* Operability with common, modern FTP clients
* SITE commands to provide a few additional file management features

If you find a bug, please create an issue on Github. Using a format similar to the following will help:

```
Behavior or FTPdLite
Expected behavior
FTP Client you're using
FTPdLite code you suspect is causing the issue
```

_Please use the issues rather than a pull request as this makes things easier to manage._

If you think of an enhancement, use the issues for that too. But, please keep in mind the goal of FTPdLite is to provide minimalist file transfer to and from microcontroller hardware using modern FTP clients. So if your request request is something outside of the realm of file transfer, or applies to an obscure client, don't be surprised if it's closed without being implemented.
