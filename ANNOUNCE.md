# FTPdLite
I've been working on an async FTP server and I thought I'd share. It's mostly for my own education, but it could be useful for some folks.

## What is it?
A minimalist, mostly RFC 959 compliant, asyncio FTP server for MicroPython-based microcontrollers.

## How do I get it?
You can use mpremote mip install github:DavesCodeMusings/ftpdlite

Or you can visit the project site at https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/ftpdlite/

## For the love of God, man... why?
FTP is one of the earliest internet protocols. It's a security nightmare, but it's a pretty straightforward way to get files from point A to point B. And MicroPython asyncio is something I've been interested in learning more about. So, why not?

>Plus, There's only about nine and a half hours of daylight this time of year. I need something to keep my sanity.

## What else is there?
It's probably got bugs I don't know about, but for the case of a single user uploading and downloading files, it works. Tested clients include: _FileZilla_ (with simultaneous connections set to 1), _curl_, _wget_, and  _tnftp_. (Windoze _ftp.exe_ works too, but not behind a firewall.)

Using asyncio means it does handle multiple sessions, but only one session per client IP address. So still limited in some ways.

There are some extra features built into the SITE command. Together with the _tnftp_ client's extra commands, it makes for a rather sublime remote file management experience. The sample session below demonstrates some of the functionality.

## Sample Session
